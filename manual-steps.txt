Not everything is easily automated. These are the things I believe that cannot be reasonabily automated:
- Restart session to make docker group configuration take effect
- Change postman theme to black
- Change postman to use dual vertical panels
- run nvm install --lts (NVM is an alias loaded in bashrc and I cannot find a way to launch it from python. Using bash -i to force the loading of .bashrc for some reason causes the python process to stop. See: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/101620/how-to-load-bashrc-from-bash-c)
- run npm install -g kafka-console (needs node installed, see item above)
- run npm install -g bull-repl (needs node installed, see item above)
- if there is a need to update AWSCLI, the uninstallation needs to be done manually
